Hello! I'm Max or @MaxStanton
I'm interested in all sorts of projects but mostly game design and full stack web development.
I'm currently learning how to make a 3D game engine from scratch using python.
I would love to colaborate on any open source project :-)
The best way to reach me is my email, maxstanton432@gmail.com
